# cross-language-SingletonPattern
The singleton design pattern is a way to ensure that a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to that instance. This can be useful in situations where it is important to limit the number of instances of a class that are created, or to provide a global point of access to a specific instance of a class.

In this repository, you will find examples of how to implement the singleton pattern in five different programming languages: Java, C++, Python, Go, and Ruby. Each example uses a technique called "lazy initialization" to create the singleton instance only when it is needed, rather than at the time the class is defined. This can be useful if the singleton instance is expensive to create, or if it is not used in every part of the application.
