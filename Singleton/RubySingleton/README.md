To use this singleton class, you can call the instance class method to get the instance of the singleton:

```ruby
s = Singleton.instance
```

The first time this method is called, it will create a new instance of the Singleton class and assign it to the @@instance class variable. Every subsequent call to instance will return the same instance.

This implementation uses a technique called "lazy initialization" to create the singleton instance only when it is needed, rather than creating it at the time the Singleton class is defined. This can be useful if the singleton instance is expensive to create, or if it is not used in every part of the application.
