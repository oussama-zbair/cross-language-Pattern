This is an implementation of the Factory design pattern in Go, which allows for the creation of objects through an interface in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that are created. The code includes an interface for a Product class, concrete product classes, an interface for a Factory class, and concrete factory classes that create specific types of product objects. The main function demonstrates how the factory and product classes can be used to create product objects without knowing the details of object creation.
