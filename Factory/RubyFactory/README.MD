This is an implementation of the Factory design pattern in Ruby, which allows for the creation of objects through an interface in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that are created. The code includes an interface for a Product class, concrete product classes, an interface for a Factory class, and concrete factory classes that create specific types of product objects. Client code can use the factory object to create product objects without knowing the details of object creation.
