To use this singleton class, you can call the GetInstance function to get the instance of the singleton:

```go
s := GetInstance()
```


The first time this function is called, it will create a new instance of the Singleton struct and assign it to the instance variable. Every subsequent call to GetInstance will return the same instance.

This implementation uses a technique called "lazy initialization" to create the singleton instance only when it is needed, rather than creating it at the time the GetInstance function is defined. This can be useful if the singleton instance is expensive to create, or if it is not used in every part of the application.
